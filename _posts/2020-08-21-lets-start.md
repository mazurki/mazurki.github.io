Hi! I'm Marta and I work as a UX designer. I read first article about user experience when I was on the second year of psychology. Since then, I discovered that UX design is quite a broad discipline so I decided to write down my observations and experience which I gained during my journey. In a form of short notes I will share my thoughts and tips with you.

I hope you'll enjoy it!
