When I try to explain what I do, I usually start with 'UX is indirect way of helping people to solve their problems'. Indirect, because through some medium, like app or website, I can meet users needs. And  experience is everything around. So in general, we have people (users) and their interactions with basically anything (experience). To make it pleasurable and help achieve their goals, there are people who design this experience. This is, in short, what I do.
