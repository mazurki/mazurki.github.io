I wasn't here for a while. Shame on me. There are few reasons for my absence. First of all, I'm a part of the [UX Hive](https://mazurki.github.io/2021/02/20/ux-hive.html), and I didn't suppose it would be so much time- and energy-consuming (also very satisfying). Secondly, I'm at the end of the coaching studies. Now, it's time for my sample coaching session. I've also started creating my UX portfolio. Last time, I did it 3 years ago, and since then, I haven't needed to do a new one. I also work, struggle with my daily chores, and in between, I just try to relax. All of that forced me to prioritize my activities. Unfortunately, the blog is almost at the end of the list. I will drop here from time to time to leave my various thoughts about UX. I hope to write a post at least once a month, so stay tuned.
