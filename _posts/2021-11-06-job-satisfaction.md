It's been over four months since I started working at OLX. It started very slowly with getting to know the organization and the coworkers. Next, I had my small projects, and now I'm responsible for research in one of the OLX's pillars, including a few teams. More responsibilities mean more work. I can't remember the last time I was this busy. Sometimes after a day full of meetings and completing task after task, I am exhausted. And at the same time, fulfilled and happy. I call it positive tiredness.  I see that my work is needed and that the stakeholders benefit from it, and most importantly, that ultimately our users benefit from it. Tackling a few projects at the same time might be overwhelming for a long time, but from time to time, it's ok. I treat it as a challenge and a possibility to learn. In the end, I'll get rewarded with the positive exhaustion that comes with professional fulfillment. I wish the same for you!
