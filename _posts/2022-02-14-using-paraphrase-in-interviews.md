A paraphrase is like a magic spell. People suddenly start opening up and talking. It struck me again last week during moderated usability tests.<br/>
<br/>
For the whole week, I talked with the users. Some of them had so much to say that I needed to slow them down. With other users, I struggled to extract a few more words. Even for open questions, they had short answers. It's a typical situation during interviews because people are just different.<br/>
<br/>
At some point, I noticed that when I paraphrase user words, they start opening a bit. Sometimes, they just confirmed my statement. But in many cases, they added new important information. Success!<br/>
<br/>
What is a paraphrase? It's a technique of restatement using other words to clarify the meaning. However, during my psychology studies, I learned that it helps clients open up. Paraphrasing shows our speakers that they listened, and that creates the relation. I use it as a natural part of many conversations. You may try to do it as well!<br/>
<br/>
But before you start, bonus tip from me. Avoid doing that with talkative users. You'll have a hard time finishing your interview :)
