Paraphrase is like a magic spell. People suddenly start opening up and talking. It struck me again last week during moderated usability tests.<br/>
<br/>
For the whole week, I talked with users. Some of them had so much to say that I needed to slow them down. With other users, I struggled to squeze out a few more words. They had short answers, even for open questions. It's a typical situation during interviews because people are just different.<br/>
<br/>
At some point, I noticed that when I paraphrase user words, they start opening a bit. Sometimes, they just confirmed my statement. But in many cases, they added new important information. Success!<br/>
<br/>
What is a paraphrase? It's a technique of restatement using other words to clarify the meaning. During my psychology studies, I learned that it helps client open up. Paraphrasing shows the speaker that you hear them, and that builds the relationship. Paraphrase makes the conversation natural. Removes the envelope of formalities. The interview is no longer a ping-pong game where one player is called 'question' and the other is called 'answer'.<br/>
<br/>
Next time, try to use paraphrase! But before you start, bonus tip from me. Avoid doing that with talkative users. You'll have a hard time finishing your interview :)
