Last Wednesday, I joined UX Open Coffee, an on-line meetup for Warsaw IDF (Interaction Design Foundation) Group. It was my first meetup in this form, and I was positively surprised. Among 2,5h, I talked with many UX enthusiasts about mental health apps, psychology in UX, UX audits, or even VR for animals. It was such a great time. Can't wait for our next meeting!
