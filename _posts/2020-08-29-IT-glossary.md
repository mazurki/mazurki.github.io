If you met me 5 years ago and told me to look into the backlog before planning session, and to estimate tasks in the story points, I would have panicked. Backlog, retrospective, story points, sprints, scrum master are typical words which I hear every day in IT company working in Agile methodology but no one had told me that I should have known them as a UX designer. There are some others like gerrit, code review, commit, branch, etc. Developers very rarely distinguish wireframe from prototype, so why should we pay attention to their world? Because UX is also a communication tool and we, as designers, should try to communicate with others with all our efforts. After all, it is thanks to the developers that our projects become alive and real.
