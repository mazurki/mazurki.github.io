It's been a week since [Config](https://config.figma.com/) – design conference organized by Figma. The event's website is overdesigned with ugly colors but I decided to give it a try. After all, Figma is one of my favorite tools. I was positively surprised with the registration form and their real desire to be inclusive. They asked me directly what they have to provide so I won't be excluded from the conference. I've never met such an attitude, cool! The whole event was handled online on the Hoppin platform which was very convenient in the pandemia times.<br/>
<br/>
On the first day, I watched the [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQsVmhSa4X-G3lHlUtejzLA) by Dylan Field (Figma's CEO) who uncovered the new features and tools like audio calls, FigJam (digital whiteboard), or Figma App. Sounds promising!<br/>
<br/>
Then, I listened to the [speech about spatial software](https://config.figma.com/talks/exploring-spatial-software/). It was new and interesting for me, even if the guy presented a very general concept. On that day, I also saw two other presentations. Linda Dounia Rebeiz told [her story](https://config.figma.com/talks/even-by-design/) of coming back to her roots as a designer and not going with the mainstream. She also showed different exercises which she will add as a toolkit to Figma. And the presentation itself was so simple and beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
I finished the day with the [keynote about Biden - Harris campaign](https://config.figma.com/talks/designing-the-biden-harris-campaign/). I was disappointed, to be honest. I expected tips on how to prepare this type of design. The speaker uncovered some decisions behind the project but it was rather chaotic jumping along with one big Figma file. Not to mention the fact that half of the presentation was a private, rather boring story of several years of the presenter's life.<br/>
<br/>
On the second day, I hadn't much time to attend. I saw few speeches from which I only liked two of them. The first [speech about rapid prototyping](https://config.figma.com/talks/rapid-prototype-testing/) was led by Figma researchers. They explained briefly how the audio calls in Figma were tested – can't wait for that feature! And another one was about [creating illustrations in Figma](https://config.figma.com/talks/figm-illustrations/) by Joey Lamelas. Yes, illustrations in Figma. Sounds impossible, right? Magic!<br/>
<br/> 
It was my first time at that conference and not the last one. See you next year!
