I spent the last months being interviewed for the UX Researcher position. I've talked to dozens of recruiters, team leaders, and team members. After each such conversation, I wrote down the questions they asked me. Here is a comprehensive list of them.<br/>
<br/>

<h5 class="in-post-headers">Company and product-related</h5><br/>
You may expect recruiters will check your knowledge about their company and product. I can't imagine applying for the position without any clue about the firm. But I guess it happens if recruiters ask about it anyway. Once, it felt almost like an attack. The recruiter shot the very first question without any chit-chat. 'What do you know about the product and our company?' Bang!<br/>
- Why do you want to work with us?<br/>
- What is our product about?<br/>
- What do you know about our product?<br/>
- What attracted you the most to our offer?<br/>
- How do you feel about being the first researcher on the team?<br/>
- What was your motivation to apply to our company?<br/>
<br/>

<h5 class="in-post-headers">Collaboration</h5><br/>
Almost in each interview, I got these questions. No surprise. A research position demands an ability to cooperate with others. Some of the questions are similar and ask about the same thing. However, I give them to you, so you're not surprised with any form of them during the interview.<br/>
- How do you collaborate with stakeholders?<br/>
- Who have you worked with, and how?<br/>
- Which stakeholders did you work with, and what was the collaboration like?<br/>
- How do you work on defining ways of working with a new team?<br/>
- How do you build and maintain trust with your stakeholders?<br/>
<br/>

<h5 class="in-post-headers">Previous experience</h5><br/>
This is a background check in various forms. Usually, they asked me about the company profile and the product I worked on. I feel recruiters like the word "responsibilities," and they try to catch what were my main tasks.<br/>
- What milestones did you achieve in your previous work?<br/>
- Can you tell me more about your previous experience?<br/>
- What were you responsible for as a UX Researcher in that project?<br/>
- What are your responsibilities in your current position?<br/>
- What were the research questions you tried to answer in your previous project?<br/>
- What is the product you worked on?<br/>
- What was the profile of your last company?<br/>
<br/>

<h5 class="in-post-headers">Methods and ways of work</h5><br/>
I expected more of them. However, I sometimes mentioned the answers describing my previous roles. During the portfolio presentation for the team, I also showed some methods I used.<br/>
- What research methods do you use?<br/>
- Do you know and use affinity maps?<br/>
- Have you ever done usability tests?<br/>
- How do you share research results?<br/>
- How long usually does each step in your research project take?<br/>
<br/>

<h5 class="in-post-headers">Me as researcher</h5><br/>
Some questions were related to me as a person, not only the experience. Think about your strengths to not be distracted when the times come. Show your self-awareness and reflection. Think which of the assets fits the role description.<br/>
- How did your research career start?<br/>
- Why did you become a researcher?<br/>
- What do you like the most about being a researcher?<br/>
- What is your greatest research asset?<br/>
- What are your biggest research strengths?<br/>
- What would you like to improve or work on?<br/>
<br/>

<h5 class="in-post-headers">Behavioral questions</h5><br/>
One company sent me a description of their recruitment process. They warned me there would be behavioral questions during the conversation. I started googling, obviously. I found out that the best way to answer such questions is to use the STAR model. Say about your (or imagined) experience in the following structure:<br/>
**S** - Situation. What was the challenge?<br/>
**T** - Task. What did I have to do to solve it?<br/>
**A** - Action. What actions did I take and why?<br/>
**R** - Result. What was the outcome of my actions?<br/>
I recommend you to check more examples online.<br/>
- What would you do if the manager changed the deadline?<br/>
- If you only had two weeks to research, how much confidence would you have with your findings?<br/>
- Why would you engage the designer from the very beginning of the process?<br/>
- If you had to choose one of the research methods to answer that task which one would it be?<br/>
- What challenging situations did you have in your previous job, and how did you deal with them?<br/>
<br/>

<h5 class="in-post-headers">Most surprising</h5><br/>
I wasn't prepared for them...
- What do you do for fun?<br/>
- How many free days do you have in your current job?<br/>
- What must happen that you would decide to leave our company?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So that's it. What answers did I give? Was it successful? Not always. However, I passed almost every conversation with the recruiter and finally got the job. I'll write about it next time. &#128522;<br/>

If you're not sure how you'd perform in a job interview, try to find a mentor on <a href="https://app.adplist.org/">ADP List</a>. There are so many talented people there, and they are eager to discuss all your issues. Give it a try! I did it, and that strengthened my confidence a lot.<br/>
