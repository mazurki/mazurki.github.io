Today's post has its roots in the case study I did on one of the interviews. I was supposed to present a plan for the discovery phase. What is it? To put it bluntly, the moment when you are looking for answers to your questions. To do it, you need, well, questions.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like we ask many questions, and at the same time, we don't do it at all. Who didn't ask Google about barely anything recently? (Look, the question again!) How to bake a cheesecake? Who did invent a telescope? Why are people poor? Where to go on holiday in February? And who did ask the friend or partner about it? Or at least what are their plans for the upcoming weekend? We tend to say a lot about ourselves and exchange statements. However, questions usually push the conversation forward and open doors with new unknown areas to explore.<br/>
<br/>
Researchers tend to do it when creating a plan for the study. Our role is to ask questions, be curious, not be satisfied with the answers, and deepen them to the limit. We start with so-called research questions. What would we like to discover? Only when you know what you are looking for can you choose the methods to find it. Questions are the basis of my work.<br/>
<br/>
What about my private life? I have a list of questions to which I don't have answers yet. They are crucial to me. It's because they mainly concern my future. Some of them keep bothering me all the time. I have a question about the purpose of life there too. Don't laugh. When I meet a new person, I always ask questions. I'm interested in who they are, what they do, and what they like or don't. I give them my attention, and they are happy so that they don't stop talking. It's fine. Maybe no one gives them time to listen?<br/>
<br/>
Listen! We can't forget about it. Listen to the answers. It applies to interviews as well as social life. That is why you ask questions.
