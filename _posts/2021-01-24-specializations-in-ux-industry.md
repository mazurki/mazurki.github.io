Yesterday, I talked with my UX friend about the industry. After more than three years in this position, I'm still concerned about my knowledge and skills. I told him that I'm afraid that I'll eventually have problems with finding a new job. At the same time, I feel more confident, but I also know how much I don't know yet. It occurred that he has the same feelings, which cheered me up a little that I'm not alone. And then, I concluded that UX, sooner or later, will divide into smaller areas of specialization. Just as every doctor is not a surgeon, not every UX designer will be a researcher. Some of us will be great at designing mobile apps, while others will be great at web apps. Some of us will be familiar with e-commerce and others with internal systems. Of course, we will all know UX in the broadest sense, but we don't have to be experts in everything right away.
