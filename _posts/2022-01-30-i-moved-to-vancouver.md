If I had to describe Vancouver in a few words, I'd say glass buildings, water, runners, and dogs. That's my first impression. I've been here for a week and don't know yet how long I'll stay. <br/>
<br/>
My partner got a job in Vancouver, and we decided to move. We're temporarily living in Yaletown, Downtown. Along our street, there are leaves imprinted on the sidewalk. It's a gorgeous accent during the walk. I don't know the city very well yet, but obviously, everything is ahead of me. <br/>
<br/>
I still work for OLX, with a nine-hour difference between Canada and Europe. Honestly, it's pretty cool to have morning appointments (I'm motivated to get up at 7 am) and then all day to complete the task without any distractions. It's quite an efficient solution. However, I may start looking for a job in the long run. I have a Canadian work permit, and it shouldn't be a problem. I am fascinated by the work culture in different countries, so this is a unique opportunity to get familiar with the local companies. I can learn a lot by being here, and that's the best part of my move. <br/>
