Have you heard about Design Sprint? It's a five days intensive workshop. During that time, participants define the problem, look for a solution and test it with real users. It's not only for designers but rather for a multidisciplinary group of people working on the same topic. More about it you can read [here](https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint). <br/>
<br/>
Last week I could cofacilitate such an event for the first time. And it was a remote Design Sprints. Here are my thoughts on that.<br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Have a good partner in crime.</strong> Prepare the setup with the second facilitator. Divide work and exercises you will lead. Each day meet for a short discussion before and after the workshop. In the morning, check if you're ready, and how you can help each other that day. In the evening, do a short summary, give yourself feedback and refine your strategy for the next day.</li>
<li><strong>Create working space.</strong> All participants must look at the same thing during the event, so having a virtual board is helpful. There is a lot of supportive software, ie. Miro or FigJam.</li>
<li><strong>Find a convenient way to communicate with another facilitator.</strong> In my case, we decided on private chat in Zoom. We didn't want to jump from one window to another on the laptop or look on the phone.</li>
<li><strong>Have reliable internet and prepare all the tools before the event.</strong> Help your participants with any technical issues. It's good to check if they have access to the programs like Zoom or Miro in advance.</li>
<li><strong>Ask participants to turn on their cameras.</strong> It's easier to engage in the process if the group sees each other. And you can control the atmosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare a lot of examples and put them into the working space.</strong> Not everyone could participate in a similar workshop, so visualization of the outcome will help them understand the task.</li>
<li><strong>Always tell the group how much time they have on the task.</strong> Set the timer as well. Use music (some tools already provide it) to keep participants focused or creative.</li>
<li><strong>When presenting the work, share your screen.</strong> A group may follow you in the software, or you can follow the current presenter. In that way, all of you will look at the same area of the screen.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare a separate tool for the retro.</strong> No matter if you do it as a last part of the workshop or after it. People should feel comfortable with sharing feedback, so anonymity is crucial. Explain how you will use it and if you share it with a group.</li>
<li><strong>Be flexible, and don't be afraid to improvise!</strong> Not everything goes with the plan, but don't be stressed and have fun too &#128578; </li>
