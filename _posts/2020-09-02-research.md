Good UX meets users' needs, obviously. To deeply understand them, designer or researcher has to conduct research. Depending on the stage in the process, approach and methods change. At the begining, it might be exploration of the domain using IDIs or by reading (especially if it's very specific and we don't know much about it), further you may validate your first ideas (surveys, gorilla testing, clickable prototypes on maze.design etc.) and at the end, do A/B tests. After release, continously monitor your users' opinions and based on that improve the product. Good UX is closely related to research and designers, who ignore it, will never achieve the best possible solution for their users.
