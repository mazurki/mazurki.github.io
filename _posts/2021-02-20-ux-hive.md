Last month, I became a member of UX Hive â€“ a new group for UX practitioners. Our mission is to create a safe space to grow UXness for any person. Inclusiveness is critical for us. As a result, I have recently met many fantastic people with whom I can collaborate and create something interesting and useful for others. For now, I write social media content and help with the overall organization. If you want to read some of my texts, go to our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/theUXHive) and have a look at UX Alphabet posts. Moreover, we organize an online meetup each month called UX Open Coffee. Feel free to join us and let's meet face to face there!
