Who would have thought that I would change jobs twice in the last year? I do not. Life writes unforeseen scenarios as usual.<br/>
<br/>
I moved to Canada at the beginning of the year. Moving is not only about finding a new place to live, but also about looking for a new job. I started even before I came here. However, to start applying for job as a foreigner, I had to have a work permit. So I waited until my foot stood on Canadian ground. There are a few ways to find a job in the UX industry in Canada. I started with Linkedin, then moved to Glassdoor. There are also Facebook groups, but I didn't check them though. After a week since my first application, I had over a dozen interviews in my calendar.<br/>
<br/>
There was one job offer that stood out from others. My intuition told me that this would be my future company. At the same time, I thought that I was not good enough to become a part of it. I was wrong. I always wanted to do something meaningful in life rather than wasting time on another game app in Play or App Store. [BenchSci](https://www.benchsci.com/) gave me that. <br/>
<br/>
The company started as a startup few years back and now is growing with increadible speed. We're giving bench scientists tools to make their experiments faster with a higher chance of success. I wasn't aware that drug discovery process might take even ten years! In addition, 80% of experiments fail, which means wasted time, ingredients and money. In such a speed (or lack of it), patients will rather die than get appropriate treatment. Helping bench scientist, we can help people in need. I'm super happy that I can be part of it! Thank you for this opportunity!
