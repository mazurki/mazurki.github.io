Who hadn't dreamed about traveling? Since you probably still have to work, workation is a solution!<br/>
<br/>
I recently spent a month working from Croatia. In the beginning, I planned to go there for holidays. However, ticket prices and the length of travel convinced me to stay there longer. One month's holiday wasn't an option for me, so I decided to work and travel. If you want to do the same thing, here's a short how-to.<br/>
<br/>
It's easier if you know the place in advance. You can be sure about an internet connection or a comfortable space to work. I checked the internet plans before as well. I also let my team know that I would work different hours, and they wouldn't be surprised. Because I was at that location previously, I didn't feel the urge to do sightseeing. That's why I could enjoy the views and the weather rather than rushing to the museum. I didn't have a fear of missing something. And it was a great time.<br/>
