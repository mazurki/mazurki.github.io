Sometimes, when I have an idea in mind, I can't wait to start prototyping. But (unexpectedly) there are so many holes in my solution! Classic. I find it very difficult to cut from thinking about the interface. The first step, which we should always do, is to get to know the users. Discover how they achieve their goals now and what they feel.  Based on that, create a user journey. I know two definitions of it. First, it's the step by step path of the user presenting motivations, pain points, and emotions in his real world. The second definition is also about users' emotions but during app usage. No matter which one is closer to the truth, designers usually underestimate this method. Much more often, only the user flow is used. But how are we able to determine the user flow if it doesn't correspond to what the user does in reality and what he feels? How can we solve his problems? The answer is - create user journeys, then user flows!
