Do you know the feeling when you have a lot of material to analyze and don't know where to start? It could be an interview scenario or answering open-ended questions. I had such a situation not so long ago, and it turned out that there is quite a simple solution to it. [Dovetail](https://dovetailapp.com/)! I was struck by how easy this app is to use and how helpful it can be to a researcher. All you need to do is select a piece of text and add a tag you have created earlier. Easy isn't it? You can also change the color and see the table of label proportions! The theme analysis has never been so much fun!
