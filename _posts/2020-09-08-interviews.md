Not so long ago, I was bored with my work. Unnoticed, monotony crept in quietly because Product Managers postponed the release date of the new product version. Last month, I did a lot of repetitive activities, such as application testing and bug reporting. Today, however, a breakthrough occurred. We started moderated tests with users, and new energy appeared immediately! Some respondents had a big problem with the tasks, others did them very quickly, almost flawlessly. However, I was most happy when the users shared their experience and told us how they use our product. The heart grows when I see that there are people who care about our app and appreciate what we do.
