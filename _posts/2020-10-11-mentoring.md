A few weeks ago, I got a new role. We hired new designers, and I'm a buddy to one of them. It happened that I'm almost ten years younger than the girl who just started her UX adventure. I had mixed feelings at the beginning - how should I act? How to give her any advice? How to say that she made a mistake? Giving feedback is difficult, but giving feedback to someone older than you is even more difficult! However, due to the Situational Leadership Theory, you have to be a mentor for newbies. So I am, and so far, it's working.
