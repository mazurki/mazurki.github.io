One week ago I quit my job. After three years of working there as a UX designer and researcher, I can say that this was a great first job. It wasn't perfect but certainly a good one. Let me tell you about the reasons behind my resignation and what lessons I learned.<br/>
<br/>
In late April, a recruiter messaged me on LinkedIn. He asked me to participate in the recruitment process for a UX researcher position. I said, "Why not?". I gave it a try and (to my surprise) got the job. Frankly, I didn't expect this ending to my story at my current company. The recruitment process was very demanding, and it took me one month - I will probably write a separate post about it.<br/>
<br/>
It all coincided with me thinking about my current job. We were in the middle of a change (as usual), the outcome of which was hard to predict. Moreover, since I joined the company, I have tried to create a proper UX process. I failed. We weren't mature or experienced enough to achieve it. It's no one's fault. None of us work as a UX designer before. However, during that time, we improved many areas, such as introducing more research and testing with users. We had a lot of brainstorming sessions with various stakeholders. But still, something was missing. We couldn't create an entire A to Z process that we were proud of it. Without feedback from professionals, it was somewhat difficult for us.<br/>
<br/>
In the course of my work, I met many wonderful people from whom I learned a lot. And my closest teammates became my friends. Now I can talk to developers, managers, or customer support. I like to look at a problem from different perspectives and involve many people in the solution early. My job is the art of compromise. I take into account each point of view and try to create the best possible design. I had a lot of freedom in how I wanted to work, but I didn't always know how myself. Last lesson - without broad research, we can't be good UX designers. Anyway, I appreciate everything that I got from this company. <br/>
<br/>
Now, it's time to gain new skills in a new place. I see no other way to learn how to do things right than by joining a large and experienced company. It will allow me to get feedback from a lot of people working in UX and research. I can't wait for that!
