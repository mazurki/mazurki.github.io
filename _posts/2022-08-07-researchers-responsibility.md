I considered myself quite experienced in setting and achieving goals. Recently, I had to set goals in a new company, and after presenting them to my manager, he asked me: "Why do you want to do this?". Consternation. Isn't it obvious? <br/>

It doesn't matter what you do if it turns out that the product has no value for the user. Shoot! It was true. The company hired me to help them unlock the value of the product. Validate our ideas so that they meet user needs. It doesn't matter if I use a thousand different research methods to triangulate data if I can't bring any conclusions to the table. Triangulation of data for triangulation's sake won't move the product forward. So easy and so mind-blowing.
