      <p>I'm Marta and I apply psychology to UX. Need a coaching session? <a href="/coaching.html">Let's talk!</a></p>
      <p>I have a master's degree in Psychology, I finished Human Resource Management postgraduate studies and I'm a certified coach. I learned design principles and UX in practice working as a UX designer and researcher. It became my passion.</p>
      <p>Here, I write about my experience and my perspective on the above issues - UX, design, and coaching. I hope you'll enjoy it. If you need extra support in achieving your goals, here you can also <a href="/coaching.html">schedule the coaching session</a>.</p>
      <p>In my spare time, I do yoga, read books and sometimes draw or create analog collages. Traveling is my second name. I also love being in nature but ask me to visit a museum or gallery and I'm yours! </p>
