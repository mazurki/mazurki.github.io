      <p>I'm Marta and I apply psychology to UX. I currently live in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
      <p>I have a master's degree in Psychology, I finished Human Resource Management postgraduate studies and I'm a certified coach. I learned design principles and UX in practice working as a UX designer and researcher. It became my passion.</p>
      <p>Here, I write about my experience and my perspective on the above issues - UX and design. I hope you'll enjoy it.</p>
      <p>I am a lover of nature and trips to mountains and forests, but I also like visiting museums and galleries. I generally love traveling. In my spare time, I do yoga, read books, sometimes draw or create analog collages.
      <p>Do you have any questions? <a href="mailto: marta.mazurkiewicz@outlook.com">Write to me!</a></p>
