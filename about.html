      <p>My name is Marta and I use psychology in UX. I am originally from Warsaw, Poland, but I currently live in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
      <p>I have a master's degree in psychology, I have completed postgraduate studies in Human Resources Management and I am an aspiring coach. I learned the principles of design and UX in practice working as a UX designer and researcher. It has become my passion.</p>
      <p>Here I am writing about my experience and my perspective on the above issues - UX and design. I hope you will like it.</p>
      <p>I love nature, mountain and forest trips, but I also like visiting museums and galleries. I love travelling, exploring new places, and discovering people's stories and cultures. In my spare time, I do yoga, read books, and sometimes draw and create analog or digital collages.</p>
